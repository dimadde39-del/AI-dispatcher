# Current State

## Phase

Current phase: pre-foundation setup.

The project operating system, documentation structure, agent rules, and initial architecture decisions are being established before product code is built.

## Product Direction

AI Dispatcher is a SaaS for Kazakhstan field service masters. It captures missed calls through call forwarding to an AI dispatcher, extracts lead details, and sends actionable lead cards to masters in Telegram.

The product sells saved orders, not an "AI bot".

## Active Surfaces

- Backend/API.
- Internal admin UI.
- Supabase database.
- Telegram master interface.
- Vapi webhook integration later.

## Deferred Surfaces

- Mobile app.
- Customer-facing marketplace.
- Customer-facing landing.
- Billing provider integration.
- Self-host Pipecat voice stack.
- Squad mode.
- WhatsApp/SMS client notifications.
- Public auth/customer accounts.

## Architecture Baseline

- Use layered architecture: domain, application, infrastructure, app API, app admin.
- Supabase Postgres is the initial database foundation.
- Telegram is the primary master interface for pilots.
- Vapi integration must stay behind a voice-provider abstraction.
- Provider raw payloads should be stored for debugging and audit.

## Next Step

Build product foundation:

- Database schema.
- Domain types and status enums.
- Repository interfaces and Supabase implementations.
- Internal admin skeleton.
